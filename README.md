# TKDht11
Particle Photon with Dht11 and Uptime stamp

TkDht11 is based on the original Dht11tester.ino from
http://www.ladyada.net/learn/sensors/dht.html

with changings and additional code to get published the data : Humid, Temp (C) and Celvin every 15 secound to
the Particle Cloud.

To get the code worked on the Photon Core, just add a new App in Particle Build
copy and paste the the code from here for new *.ino, *.cpp and *.h

Then you can make further changings or additional code for further option
Woulkd be nice, if you get more function to work, if you let it known here :-)

Thanks
